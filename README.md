##### Problems Encountered
- The Wheel of Time is a huge series (14+ books) and according to Wikipedia has 2787 distinct named characters.
- The most readily accessible sources for character names have variable formatting even within the same webpage; on top of this, there are only so many character names that can be listed conveniently.
- Characters in novels can go by different aliases, nicknames, and titles, and this is especially true for the Wheel of Time. Characters may be referred to be surnames, nicknames, past lives, etc. Accounting for this is integral to accurate analysis.
