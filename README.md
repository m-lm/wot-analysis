# Wheel of Time Data Analysis

### Data analysis for the Wheel of Time fantasy book series written by Robert Jordan.

#### Introduction
This is a data analysis pet project written in Python using Selenium, spaCy, networkX, and pyvis to extract and visualize information about the characters of the Wheel of Time. The goal is to learn more about the character relationships of my favorite book series as well as to gain working familiarity with graph networks, data mining, and natural language processing.

#### Analysis

#### Visualization

#### Problems Encountered
- The Wheel of Time is a huge series (14+ books) and according to Wikipedia has 2787 distinct named characters. We only track 268 of the most important or recurring characters.
- The most readily accessible sources for character names have variable formatting even within the same webpage; on top of this, there are only so many character names that can be listed conveniently.
- Characters in novels can go by different aliases, nicknames, and titles, and this is especially true for the Wheel of Time. Characters may be referred to by surnames, nickname, etc. This should be factored in for the most important main characters at the very least. 
- A few scraped character names were manually cleaned after gathering.

#### Conclusion
