      "and ready to draw. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As a particularly strong blast tugged the cloak out of his hand, he glanced at his father over the back of \n",
      "the shaggy brown mare. He felt a little foolish about wanting to reassure himself that Tam was still there, \n",
      "but it was that kind of day. The wind howled when it rose, but aside from that, quiet lay heavy on the \n",
      "land. The soft creak of the axle sounded loud by comparison. No birds sang in the forest, no squirrels \n",
      "chittered from a branch. Not that he expected them, really; not this spring. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Only trees that kept leaf or needle through the winter had any green about them. Snarls of last year's \n",
      "bramble spread brown webs over stone outcrops under the trees. Nettles numbered most among the few \n",
      "weeds; the rest were the sorts with sharp burrs or thorns, or stinkweed, which left a rank smell on the \n",
      "unwary boot that crushed it. Scattered white patches of snow still dotted the ground where tight clumps \n",
      "of trees kept deep shade. Where sunlight did reach, it held neither strength nor warmth. The pale sun sat \n",
      "above the trees to the east, but its light was crisply dark, as if mixed with shadow. It was an awkward \n",
      "morning, made for unpleasant thoughts. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Without thinking he touched the nock of the arrow; it was ready to draw to his cheek in one smooth \n",
      "movement, the way Tam had taught him. Winter had been bad enough on the farms, worse than even the \n",
      "oldest folk remembered, but it must have been harsher still in the mountains, if the number of wolves \n",
      "driven down into the Two Rivers was any guide. Wolves raided the sheep pens and chewed their way \n",
      "into barns to get the cattle and horses. Bears had been after the sheep, too, where a bear had not been \n",
      "seen in years. It was no longer safe to be out after dark. Men were the prey as often as sheep, and the \n",
      "sun did not always have to be down. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tam was taking steady strides on the other side of Bela, using his spear as a walking staff, ignoring the \n",
      "wind that made his brown cloak flap like a banner. Now and again he touched the mare's flank lightly, to \n",
      "remind her to keep moving. With his thick chest and broad face, he was a pillar of reality in that morning, \n",
      "like a stone in the middle of a drifting dream. His sun-roughened cheeks might be lined and his hair have \n",
      "only a sprinkling of black among the gray, but there was a solidness to him, as though a flood could wash \n",
      "around him without uprooting his feet. He stumped down the road now impassively. Wolves and bears \n",
      "were all very well, his manner said, things that any man who kept sheep must be aware of, but they had \n",

      "\n",
      "With a guilty start Rand returned to watching his side of the road, Tam's matter-of-factness reminding \n",
      "him of his task. He was a head taller than his father, taller than anyone else in the district, and had little of \n",
      "Tam in him physically, except perhaps for a breadth of shoulder. Gray eyes and the reddish tinge to his \n",
      "hair came from his mother, so Tam said. She had been an outlander, and Rand remembered little of her \n",

      "for use during Bel Tine, and he had declared that it would take more than wolves or a cold wind to stop \n",
      "him this spring. Even so they had not been to the village for weeks. Not even Tam traveled much these \n",
      "days. But Tam had given his word about the brandy and cider, even if he had waited to make delivery \n",
      "until the day before Festival. Keeping his word was important to Tam. Rand was just glad to get away \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As Rand watched his side of the road, the feeling grew in him that he was being watched. For a while he \n",
      "tried to shrug it off. Nothing moved or made a sound among the trees, except the wind. But the feeling \n",
      "not only persisted, it grew stronger. The hairs on his arms stirred; his skin prickled as if it itched on the \n",
      "inside. \n",
      "\n",

      "the other. He glanced over his shoulder . . . and blinked. Not more than twenty spans back down the \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "of the hood that fascinated him. He could see only the vaguest outlines of a face, but he had the feeling he \n",
      "was looking right into the rider's eyes. And he could not look away. Queasiness settled in his stomach. \n",
      "There was only shadow to see in the hood, but he felt hatred as sharply as if he could see a snarling face, \n",
      "hatred for everything that lived. Hatred for him most of all, for him above all things. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Abruptly a stone caught his heel and he stumbled, breaking his eyes away from the dark horseman. His \n",
      "bow dropped to the road, and only an outthrust hand grabbing Bela's harness saved him from falling flat \n",

      "\"There, down the... Rand's words trailed off as he turned to point. The road behind was empty. \n",
      "Disbelieving, he stared into the forest on both sides of the road. Bare-branched trees offered no hiding \n",
      "place, but there was not a glimmer of horse or horseman. He met his father's questioning gaze. \"He was \n",

      "\"I wouldn't doubt your word, lad, but where has he gone?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know. But he was there.\" He snatched up the fallen bow and arrow, hastily checked the fletching \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "before renocking, and half drew before letting the bowstring relax. There was nothing to aim at. \"He \n",

      "Abruptly Rand realized what had been odd about the horseman, aside from his being there at all. The \n",
      "wind that beat at Tam and him had not so much as shifted a fold of that black cloak. His mouth was \n",
      "suddenly dry. He must have imagined it. His father was right; this was a morning to prickle a man's \n",
      "imagination. But he did not believe it. Only, how did he tell his father that the man who had apparently \n",
      "vanished into thin air wore a cloak the wind did not touch? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With a worried frown he peered into the woods around them; it looked different than it ever had before. \n",
      "Almost since he was old enough to walk, he had run loose in the forest. The ponds and streams of the \n",
      "Waterwood, beyond the last farms east of Emond's Field, were where he had learned to swim. He had \n",
      "explored into the Sand Hills-which many in the Two Rivers said was bad luck-and once he had even \n",
      "gone to the very foot of the Mountains of Mist, him and his closest friends, Mat Cauthon and Perrin \n",
      "Aybara. That was a lot further afield than most people in Emond's Field ever went; to them a journey to \n",
      "the next village, up to Watch Hill or down to Deven Ride, was a big event. Nowhere in all of that had he \n",
      "found a place that made him afraid. Today, though, the Westwood was not the place he remembered. A \n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, father, there's no need.\" When Tam stopped in surprise, Rand covered his flush by tugging at the \n",
      "hood of his cloak. \"You're probably right. No point looking for what isn't there, not when we can use the \n",
      "time getting on to the village and out of this wind.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I could do with a pipe,\" Tam said slowly, \"and a mug of ale where it's warm.\" Abruptly he gave a broad \n",
      "grin. \"And I expect you're eager to see Egwene. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Rand managed a weak smile. Of all things he might want to think about right then, the Mayor's daughter \n",
      "was far down the list. He did not need any more confusion. For the past year she had been making him \n",
      "increasingly jittery whenever they were together. Worse, she did not even seem to be aware of it. No, he \n",
      "certainly did not want to add Egwene to his thoughts. \n",

      "It was an odd thing Tam had taught him. Concentrate on a single flame and feed all your passions into it \n",
      "- fear, hate, anger - until your mind became empty. Become one with the void, Tam said, and you could \n",
      "do anything. Nobody else in Emond's Field talked that way. But Tam won the archery competition at Bel \n",
      "Tine every year with his flame and his void. Rand thought he might have a chance at placing this year \n",
      "himself, if he could manage to hold onto the void. For Tam to bring it up now meant he had noticed, but \n",
      "he said nothing more about it. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tam clucked Bela into motion once more, and they resumed their journey, the older man striding along \n",
      "as 1f nothing untoward had happened and nothing untoward could. Rand wished he could imitate him. He \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He wanted to believe that Tam was right, that the rider had just been his imagination, but he could \n",

      "The village lay close onto the Westwood, the forest gradually thinning until the last few trees stood \n",

      "Even those few dwindled to none miles short of the Sand Hills, not to mention the Mountains of Mist, \n",
      "which rose above the Westwood treetops, distant but in plain sight from Emond's Field. Some said the \n",
      "land was too rocky, as if there were not rocks everywhere in the Two Rivers, and others said it was \n",
      "hard-luck land. A few muttered that there was no point getting any closer to the mountains than needs be. \n",
      "Whatever the reasons, only the hardiest men farmed in the Westwood. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Small children and dogs dodged around the cart in whooping swarms once it passed the first row of \n",

      "tag and rolling hoops. In the last months there had been little of play or laughter from the children; even \n",
      "when the weather had slackened enough to let children out, fear of wolves kept them in. It seemed the \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Festival had affected the adults as well. Broad shutters were thrown back, and in almost every house the \n",
      "goodwife stood in a window, apron tied about her and long-braided hair done up in a kerchief, shaking \n",
      "sheets or hanging mattresses over the windowsills. Whether or not leaves had appeared on the trees, no \n",
      "woman would let Bel Tine come before her spring cleaning was done. In every yard rugs hung from \n",
      "stretched lines, and children who had not been quick enough to run free in the streets instead vented their \n",
      "frustration on the carpets with wicker beaters. On roof after roof the goodman of the house clambered \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Several times Tam paused to engage one man or another in brief conversation. Since he and Rand had \n",
      "not been off the farm for weeks, everyone wanted to catch up on how things were out that way. Few \n",
      "Westwood men had been in. Tam spoke of damage from winter storms, each one worse than the one \n",
      "before, and stillborn lambs, of brown fields where crops should be sprouting and pastures greening, of \n",

      "on his roof, though the thatch looked as if it badly needed Master Buie's attention. He never seemed \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you asked her the way you usually do, Wit,\" Tam said patiently, \"you're lucky she didn't thump you \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "then the Village Council has to.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What business of yours is the Wisdom, Wit Congar?\" roared a woman's voice. Wit flinched as his wife \n",
      "marched out of the house. Daise Congar was twice as wide as Wit, a hard-faced woman without an \n",
      "ounce of fat on her. She glared at him with her fists on her hips. \"You try meddling in Women's Circle \n",
      "business, and see how you like eating your own cooking. Which you won't do in my kitchen. And \n",
      "washing your own clothes and making your own bed. Which won't be under my roof.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\"If you'll pardon me, Daise,\" Tam said. \"Wit. The Light shine on you both.\" He got Bela moving again, \n",

      "could realize whom it was Wit had been talking to. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That was why they had not accepted any of the invitations to stop for a bite to eat or something hot to \n",
      "drink. When they saw Tam, the goodwives of Emond's Field went on point like hounds spotting a rabbit. \n",
      "There was not a one of them who did not know just the perfect wife for a widower with a good farm, \n",
      "even if it was in the Westwood. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Rand stepped along just as quickly as Tam, perhaps even more so. He was sometimes cornered when \n",
      "Tam was not around, with no way to escape outside of rudeness. Herded onto a stool by the kitchen fire, \n",
      "he would be fed pastries or honeycakes or meatpies. And always the goodwife's eyes weighed and \n",
      "measured him as neatly as any merchant's scales and tapes while she told him that what he was eating \n",
      "was not nearly so good as her widowed sister's cooking, or her next-to-eldest cousin's. Tam was \n",
      "certainly not getting any younger, she would say. It was good that he had loved his wife so - it boded \n",
      "well for the next woman in his life - but he had mourned long enough. Tam needed a good woman. It was \n",
      "a simple fact, she would say, or something very close, that a man just could not do without a woman to \n",
      "take care of him and keep him out of trouble. Worst of all were those who paused thoughtfully at about \n",
      "that point, then asked with elaborate casualness exactly how old he was now. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Like most Two Rivers folk, Rand had a strong stubborn streak. Outsiders sometimes said it was the \n",
      "prime trait of people in the Two Rivers, that they could give mules lessons and teach stones. The \n",
      "goodwives were fine and kindly women for the most part, but he hated being pushed into anything, and \n",
      "they made him feel as if he were being prodded with sticks. So he walked fast, and wished Tam would \n",

      "\n",
      "with thick grass, the Green this spring showed only a few fresh patches among the yellowish brown of \n",
      "dead grass and the black of bare earth. A double handful of geese waddled about, beadily eyeing the \n",

      "Toward the west end of the Green, the Winespring itself gushed out of a low stone outcrop in a flow that \n",
      "never failed, a flow strong enough to knock a man down and sweet enough to justify its name a dozen \n",
      "times over. From the spring the rapidly widening Winespring Water ran swiftly off to the east, willows \n",
      "dotting its banks all the way to Master Thane's mill and beyond, until it split into dozens of streams in the \n",
      "swampy depths of the Waterwood. Two low, railed footbridges crossed the clear stream at the Green, \n",
      "and one bridge, wider than the others and stout enough to bear wagons. The Wagon Bridge marked \n",
      "where the North Road, coming down from Taren Ferry and Watch Hill, became the Old Road, leading \n",
      "to Deven Ride. Outsiders sometimes found it funny that the road had one name to the north and another \n",
      "to the south, but that was the way it had always been, as far as anyone in Emond's Field knew, and that \n",
      "was that. It was a good enough reason for Two Rivers people. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On the far side of the bridges, the mounds were already building for the Bel Tine fires, three careful \n",

      "Near the Winespring a score of older women sang softly as they erected the Spring Pole. Shorn of its \n",

      "with the sling, and the quarterstaff. There would be contests at solving riddles and puzzles, at the rope \n",

      "a little singing and dancing. And to top everything, if the rumors could be believed, a grand display of \n",
      "fireworks was planned for the Green-if the first peddler of the year appeared in time, of course. That had \n",

      "which was topped by a sparse fringe of gray hair. The innkeeper was in his shirtsleeves despite the chill, \n",
      "with a spotless white apron wrapped around him. A silver medallion in the form of a set of balance scales \n",

      "The medallion, along with the full-size set of scales used to weigh the coins of the merchants who came \n",

      "dealing with the merchants and for festivals, feastdays, and weddings. He had it on a day early now, but \n",
      "that night was Winternight, the night before Bel Tine, when everyone would visit back and forth almost \n",
      "the whole night long, exchanging small gifts, having a bite to eat and a touch to drink at every house. After \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bran harrumphed. \"I could wish somebody wanted to talk about some- thing besides the weather. \n",
      "Everyone complains about it, and folk who should know better expect me to set it right. I've just spent \n",
      "twenty minutes explaining to Mistress al'Donel that I can do nothing about the storks. Though what she \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"An ill omen,\" a scratchy voice announced, \"no storks nesting on the rooftops at Bel Tine.\" Cenn Buie, \n",
      "as gnarled and dark as an old root, marched up to Tam and Bran and leaned on his walking staff, near as \n",
      "tall as he was and just as gnarled. He tried to fix both men at once with a beady eye. \"There's worse \n",
      "to come, you mark my words.\" \n",

      "\n",
      "\"Have you become a soothsayer, then, interpreting omens?\" Tam asked dryly. \"Or do you listen to the \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mock if you will,\" Cenn muttered, \"but if it doesn't warm enough for crops to sprout soon, more than \n",

      "\n",
      "\"This is the point, al'Thor. Ask the Wisdom when the winter will end, and she walks away. Maybe she \n",
      "doesn't want to tell us what she hears on the wind. Maybe what she hears is that the winter won't end. \n",
      "Maybe it's just going to go on being winter until the Wheel turns and the Age ends. There's your point.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Maybe sheep will fly,\" Tam retorted, and Bran threw up his hands. \"The Light protect me from fools. \n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Rand's smile broadened; it did not sound as much like fun to him as it would have a year or two back, \n",
      "but Mat never seemed to grow up. He took a quick look at his father-the men had their heads together \n",
      "still, all three talking at once - then lowered his own voice. \"I promised to unload the cider. I can meet \n",

      "\n",
      "Mat rolled his eyes skyward. \"Toting barrels! Burn me, I'd rather play stones with my baby sister. Well, \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For an instant Rand stopped breathing. \"A man on horseback?\" he asked intently. \"A man in a black \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mat swallowed his grin, and his voice dropped to an even hoarser whisper. \"You saw him, too? I \n",

      "\n",
      "\"I'm not laughing. He scared me, too. I could swear he hated me, that he wanted to kill me.\" Rand \n",
      "shivered. Until that day he had never thought of anyone wanting to kill him, really wanting to kill him. That \n",
      "sort of thing just did not happen in the Two Rivers. A fistfight, maybe, or a wrestling match, but not \n",
      "kilig, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\" I don't know about hating, Rand, but he was scary enough anyway. All he did was sit on his horse \n",

      "just for a moment - it wasn't easy, mind you - then when I looked back he'd vanished. Blood and ashes! \n",
      "Three days, it's been, and I can hardly stop thinking about him. I keep looking over my shoulder.\" Mat \n",
      "attempted a laugh that came out as a croak. \"Funny how being scared takes you. You think strange \n",

      "no sound at all came out this time. \n",

      "around the village. Few people had escaped his pranks. Now his name came up whenever a washline \n",
      "dropped the laundry in the dirt or a loose saddle girth deposited a farmer in the road. Mat did not even \n",
      "have to be anywhere around. His support might be worse than none. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gleeman!\" Mat exclaimed, stopping dead in his footsteps, at the same instant that Rand asked, \"When \n",

      "\n",
      "Rand could remember only two gleemen coming into the Two Rivers in his whole life, and for one of \n",

      "this Festival ten years off, even if there were not any fireworks. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Foolishness,\" Cenn grumbled, but fell silent at a look from Bran that had all the weight of the Mayor's \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Arrived in the dead of night, he did.\" The innkeeper shook his head in disapproval. \"Pounded on the \n",
      "front door till he woke the whole family. If not for Festival, I'd have told him to stable his own horse and \n",
      "sleep in the stall with it, gleeman or not. Imagine coming in the dark like that.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Rand stared wonderingly. No one traveled beyond the village by night, not these days, certainly not \n",
      "alone. The thatcher grumbled under his breath again, too low this time for Rand to understand more than \n",
      "a word or two. \"Madman\" and \"unnatural.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He doesn't wear a black cloak, does he?\" Mat asked suddenly. Bran's belly shook with his chuckle. \n",
      "\"Black! His cloak is like every gleeman's cloak I've ever seen. More patches than cloak, and more colors \n",
      "than you can think of. \" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Rand startled himself by laughing out loud, a laugh of pure relief. The menacing black-clad rider as a \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He clapped a hand over his mouth in embarrassment. \"You see, Tam,\" Bran said. \"There's been little \n",
      "enough laughter in this village since winter came. Now even the gleeman's cloak brings a laugh. That \n",
      "\n",

      "alone is worth the expense of bringing him down from Baerlon. \" \n",
      "\n",

      "fireworks you all insisted on sending off for.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So there are fireworks,\" Mat said, but Cenn went right on. \"They should have been here a month ago \n",
      "with the first peddler of the year, but there hasn't been a peddler, has there? If he doesn't come by \n",
      "tomorrow, what are we going to do with them? Hold another Festival just to set them off? That's if he \n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why didn't you tell us?\" Mat demanded in an aggrieved voice. \"The whole village would have had as \n",
      "much fun with the waiting as with the gleeman. Or almost, anyway. You can see how everybody's been \n",
      "over just a rumor of fireworks.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can see,\" Bran replied with a sidelong look at the thatcher. \"And if I knew for sure how that rumor \n",
      "started . . . if I thought, for instance, that somebody had been complaining about how much things cost \n",
      "where people could hear him when the things are supposed to be secret...\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cenn cleared his throat. \"My bones are too old for this wind. If you don't mind, I'll just see if Mistress \n",

      "\"Sometimes I think Nynaeve is right about . . . Well, that's not important now. You young fellows think \n",
      "for a minute. Everyone's excited about the fireworks, true, and that's only at a rumor. Think how they'll \n",
      "be if the peddler doesn't get here in time, after all their anticipating. And with the weather the way it is, \n",
      "who knows when he will come. They'd be fifty times as excited about a gleeman.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And feel fifty times as bad if he hadn't come,\" Rand said slowly. \"Even Bel Tine might not do much for \n",

      "\n",
      "\"You have a head on your shoulders when you choose to use it,\" Bran said. \"He'll follow you on the \n",

      "could name.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"None of this is unloading the cart,\" Tam said briskly, handing the first cask of brandy to the Mayor. \"I \n",
      "want a warm fire, my pipe, and a mug of your good ale.\" He hoisted the second brandy cask onto his \n",
      "shoulder. \"I'm sure Rand will thank you for your help, Matrim. Remember, the sooner the cider is in the \n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, why not?\" Mat said resignedly. \"Like your da said, the quicker it's in the cellar . . . Picking up one \n",
      "of the casks of cider in both arms, he hurried toward the inn in a half trot. \"Maybe Egwene is around. \n",
      "Watching you stare at her like a poleaxed ox will be as good as a badger any day. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Rand paused in the act of putting his bow and quiver in the back of the cart. He really had managed to \n",
      "put Egwene out of his mind. That was unusual in itself. But she would likely be around the inn \n",
      "somewhere. There was not much chance he could avoid her. Of course, it had been weeks since he saw \n",
      "her last. \n",
      "\n",

      "from a polished canister the innkeeper always kept on the plain stone mantel. The fireplace stretched half \n",

      "high-backed chairs in front of the fire, mugs in hand and blue-gray pipesmoke wreathing their heads. For \n",
      "once none of the stones boards were in use, and all of Bran's books stood idle on the shelf opposite the \n",
      "fireplace. The men did not even talk, peering silently into their ale or tapping pipestems against their teeth \n",
      "in impatience, as they waited for Tam and Bran to join them. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Worry was not uncommon for the Village Council these days, not in Emond's Field, and likely not in \n",

      "blacksmith's arms were as big as most men's legs, roped with heavy muscle, and he still wore his long \n",
      "leather apron as if he had hurried to the meeting straight from the forge. His frown took them both in, then \n",

      "his pipe with a thick thumb. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Curious, Rand slowed, then barely bit back a yelp as Mat kicked his ankle. His friend nodded insistently \n",

      "The tray in her hands carried some of the crusty loaves for which she was famous around Emond's Field, \n",

      "\n",
      "as well as plates of pickles and cheese. The food reminded Rand abruptly that he had eaten only an end \n",

      "\n",
      "warm smiles and a quick snack whenever he came by the inn, but she did as much for every young man \n",
      "in the area. If she occasionally looked at him as if she wanted to do more, at least she took it no further \n",
      "than looks, for that he was deeply grateful. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Without waiting for a reply she swept on into the common room. Immediately there was the sound of \n",
      "chairs scraping on the floor as the men got to their feet, and exclaimings over the smell of the bread. She \n",
      "was easily the best cook in Emond's Field, and not a man for miles around but eagerly leaped at a chance \n",
      "to put his feet under her table. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "A lamp hung over the cellar stairs, just beside the kitchen door, and another made a bright pool in the \n",

      "racks along the walls and across the floor held casks of brandy and cider, and larger barrels of ale and \n",
      "wine, some with taps driven in. Many of the wine barrels were marked with chalk in Bran al'Vere's hand, \n",
      "giving the year they had been bought, what peddler had brought them, and in which city they had been \n",
      "made, but all of the ale and brandy was the make of Two Rivers farmers or of Bran himself. Peddlers, \n",
      "and even merchants, sometimes brought brandy or ale from outside, but it was never as good and cost \n",
      "the earth, besides, and nobody ever drank it more than once. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now,\" Rand said, as they set their casks in the racks, \"what did you do that you have to avoid Master \n",
      "Lubhan?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mat shrugged. \"Nothing, really. I told Adan al'Caar and some of his snot-nosed friends-Ewin Finngar \n",
      "and Dag Coplin-that some farmers had seen ghost hounds, breathing fire and running through the woods. \n",
      "They ate it up like clotted cream.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And Master Luhhan is mad at you for that?\" Rand said doubtfully. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not exactly.\" Mat paused, then shook his head. \"You see, I covered two of his dogs with flour, so they \n",
      "were all white. Then I let them loose near Dag's house. How was I to know they'd run straight home? It \n",
      "really isn't my fault. If Mistress Luhhan hadn't left the door open they couldn't have gotten inside. It isn't \n",
      "like I intended to get flour all over her house.\" He gave a bark of laughter. \"I hear she chased old Luhhan \n",
      "and the dogs, all three, out of the house with a broom. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Rand winced and laughed at the same time. \"If I were you, I'd worry more about Alsbet Luhhan than \n",
      "about the blacksmith. She's almost as strong, and her temper is a lot worse. No matter, though. If you \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "walk fast, maybe he won't notice you.\" Mat's expression said he did not think Rand was funny. \n",

      "\n",
      "men had their chairs in a tight knot before the fireplace. With his back to the fire, Tam was speaking in a \n",
      "low voice, and the others were leaning forward to listen, so intent on his words they would likely not have \n",
      "noticed if a flock of sheep had been driven through. Rand wanted to move closer, to hear what they were \n",
      "talking about, but Mat plucked at his sleeve and gave him an agonized look. With a sigh he followed Mat \n",
      "out to the cart. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On their return to the hallway they found a tray by the top of the steps, and hot honeycakes filling the hall \n",
      "with their sweet aroma. There were two mugs, as well, and a pitcher of steaming mulled cider. Despite \n",
      "his own admonition about waiting until later Rand found himself making the last two trips between cart \n",
      "and cellar while trying to juggle a cask and a piping honeycake. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Setting his final cask in the racks, he wiped crumbs from his mouth while Mat was unburdening himself, \n",
      "then said, \"Now for the glee-\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Feet clattered on the stairs, and Ewin Finngar half fell into the cellar in his haste, his pudgy face shining \n",
      "with eagerness to impart his news. \"There are strangers in the village.\" He caught his breath and gave Mat \n",
      "a wry look. \"I haven't seen any ghost hounds, but I hear somebody floured Master Luhhan's dogs. I hear \n",
      "Mistress Luhhan has ideas who to look for, too.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The years separating Rand and Mat from Ewin, only fourteen, were usually more than enough for them \n",
      "to give short shrift to anything he had to say. This time they exchanged one startled glance, then both \n",
      "were talking at once. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the village?\" Rand asked. \"Not in the woods?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Right on top of him Mat added, \"Was his cloak black? Could you see his face?\" Ewin looked \n",
      "uncertainly from one of them to the other, then spoke quickly when Mat took a threatening step. \"Of \n",
      "course I could see his face. And his cloak is green. Or maybe gray. It changes. It seems to fade into \n",
      "wherever he's standing. Sometimes you don't see him even when you look right at him, not unless he \n",
      "moves. And hers is blue, like the sky, and ten times fancier than any feastday clothes I ever saw. She's \n",
      "ten times prettier than anybody I ever saw, too. She's a high-born lady, like in the stories. She must be.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Her?\" Rand said. \"Who are you talking about?\" He stared at Mat, who had put both hands on top of \n",
      "his head and squeezed his eyes shut. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They're the ones I meant to tell you about,\" Mat muttered, \"before you got me off onto-\" He cut off, \n",
      "opening his eyes for a sharp glance at Ewin. \"They arrived last evening,\" Mat went on after a moment, \n",
      "\"and took rooms here at the inn. I saw them ride in. Their horses, Rand. I never saw horses so tall, or so \n",
      "sleek. They look like they could run forever. I think he works for her.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In service,\" Ewin broke in. \"They call it being in service, in the stories.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mat continued as if Ewin had not spoken. \"Anyway, he defers to her, does what she says. Only he isn't \n",
      "like a hired man. A soldier, maybe. The way he wears his sword, it's part of him, like his hand or his foot. \n",
      "He makes the merchants’ guards look like cur dogs. And her, Rand. I never even imagined anyone like \n",
      "her. She's out of a gleeman's story. She's like .. . like . . .\"\" He paused to give Ewin a sour look.\". . . \n",
      "like a high-born lady,\" he finished with a sigh. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But who are they?\" Rand asked. Except for merchants, once a year to buy tabac and wool, and the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "peddlers, outsiders never came into the Two Rivers, or as good as never. Maybe at Taren Ferry, but not \n",
      "this far south. Most of the merchants and peddlers had been coming for years, too, so they did not really \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Page 21 \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "count as strangers. Just outsiders. It was a good five years since the last time a real stranger appeared in \n",
      "Emond's Field, and he had been trying to hide from some sort of trouble up in Baerlon that nobody in the \n",
      "village understood. He had not stayed long. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do they want?\" Mat exclaimed. \"I don't care what they want. Strangers, Rand, and strangers like \n",
      "you never even dreamed of. Think of it!\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Rand opened his mouth, then closed it without speaking. The black- cloaked rider had him as nervous \n",
      "as a cat in a dog run. It just seemed like an awful coincidence, three strangers around the village at the \n",
      "same time. Three if this fellow's cloak that changed colors never changed to black. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Her name is Moiraine,\" Ewin said into the momentary silence. \"I heard him say it. Moiraine, he called \n",
      "her. The Lady Moiraine. His name is Lan. The Wisdom may not like her, but I do. \" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What makes you think Nynaeve dislikes her?\" Rand said. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She asked the Wisdom for directions this morning,\" Ewin said, \"and called her 'child.\"\" Rand and Mat \n",
      "both whistled softly through their teeth, and Ewin tripped over his tongue in his haste to explain. \"The \n",
      "Lady Moiraine didn't know she was the Wisdom. She apologized when she found out. She did. And \n",
      "asked some questions about herbs, and about who is who around Emond's Field, just as respectfully as \n",
      "any woman in the village- more so than some. She's always asking questions, about how old people are, \n",
      "and how long they've lived where they live, and. . . oh, I don't know what all. Anyway, Nynaeve \n",
      "answered like she'd bitten a green sweetberry. Then, when the Lady Moiraine walked away, Nynaeve \n",
      "stared after her like, like . . . well, it wasn't friendly, I can tell you that.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that all?\" Rand said. \"You know Nynaeve's temper. When Cenn Buie called her a child last year, she \n",
      "thumped him on the head with her stick, and he's on the Village Council, and old enough to be her grand- \n",
      "father, besides. She flares up at anything, and never stays angry past turning around. \" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's too long for me,\" Ewin muttered. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't care who Nynaeve thumps\", Mat chortled, \"so long as it isn't me. This is going to be the best Bel \n",
      "Tine ever. A gleeman, a lady-who could ask for more? Who needs fireworks?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A gleeman?\" Ewin said, his voice rising sharply. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come on, Rand,\" Mat went on, ignoring the younger boy. \"We're done here. You have to see this \n",
      "fellow.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He bounded up the stairs, with Ewin scrambling behind him calling, \"Is there really a gleeman, Mat? This \n",
      "isn't like the ghost hounds, is it? Or the frogs?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Rand paused long enough to turn down the lamp, then hurried after them. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the common room Rowan Hurn and Samel Crawe had joined the others in front of the fire, so that the \n",
      "entire Village Council was there. Bran al'Vere spoke now, his normally bluff voice pitched so low that \n",
      "only a rumbling murmur traveled beyond the close-gathered chairs. The Mayor emphasized his words by \n",
      "capping a thick forefinger into the palm of his hand, and eyed each man in turn. They all nodded in \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "agreement with whatever he was saying, though Cenn more reluctantly than the rest. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The way the men all but huddled together spoke more plainly than a painted sign. Whatever they were \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Page 22 \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "talking about, it was for the Village Council alone, at least for now. They would not appreciate Rand \n",
      "trying to listen in. Reluctantly he pulled himself away. There was still the gleeman. And these strangers. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside, Bela and the cart were gone, taken away by Hu or Tad, the stablemen. Mat and Ewin stood \n",
      "glaring at one another a few paces from the front door of the inn, their cloaks whipping in the wind. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For the last time,\" Mat barked, \"I am not playing a trick on you. There is a Gleeman. Now go away. \n",
      "Rand, will you tell this woolhead I am telling the truth so he'll leave me alone?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Pulling his cloak together, Rand stepped forward to support Mat, but words died as the hairs stirred on \n",
      "the back of his neck. He was being watched again. It was far from the feeling the hooded rider had given \n",
      "him, but neither was it pleasant, especially so soon after that encounter. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A quick look about the Green showed him only what he had seen before children playing, people \n",
      "preparing for Festival, and no one more than glancing in his direction. The Spring Pole stood alone, now, \n",
      "waiting. Bustle and childish shouts filled the side streets. All was as it should be. Except that he was being \n",
      "watched. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then something led him to turn around, to raise his eyes. On the edge of the inn's tile roof perched a \n",
      "large raven, swaying a little in the gusting wind from the mountains. Its head was cocked to one side, and \n",
      "one beady, black eye was focused . . . on him, he thought. He swallowed, and suddenly anger flickered \n",
      "in him, hot and sharp. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Filthy carrion eater,\" he muttered. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am tired of being stared at,\" Mat growled, and Rand realized his friend had stepped up beside him and \n",
      "was frowning at the raven, too. They exchanged a glance, then as one their hands darted for rocks. The \n",
      "two stones flew true . . . and the raven stepped aside; the stones whistled through the space where it had \n",
      "been. Fluffing its wings once, it cocked its head again, fixing them with a dead black eye, unafraid, giving \n",
      "no sign that anything had happened. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Rand stared at the bird in consternation. \"Did you ever see a raven do that?\" he asked quietly. \n",
      "Mat shook his head without looking away from the raven. \"Never. Nor any other bird, either.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A vile bird,\" came a woman's voice from behind them, melodious despite echoes of distaste, \"to be \n",
      "mistrusted in the best of times.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With a shrill cry the raven launched itself into the air so violently that two black feathers drifted down \n",
      "from the roof's edge. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Startled, Rand and Mat twisted to follow the bird's swift flight, over the Green and toward the \n",
      "cloud-tipped Mountains of Mist, tall beyond the Westwood, until it dwindled to a speck in the west, then \n",
      "vanished from view. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Rand's gaze fell to the woman who had spoken. She, too, had been watching the flight of the raven, but \n",
      "now she turned back, and her eyes met his. He could only stare. This had to be the Lady Moiraine, and \n",
      "she was everything that Mat and Ewin had said, everything and more. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had heard she called Nynaeve child, he had pictured her as old, but she was not. At least, he \n",
      "could not put any age to her at all. At first he thought she was as young as Nynaeve, but the longer he \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Page 23 \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "looked the more he thought she was older than that. There was a maturity about her large, dark eyes, a \n",
      "hint of knowing that no one could have gotten young. For an instant he thought those eyes were deep \n",
      "pools about to swallow him up. It was plain why Mat and Ewin named her a lady from a gleeman's tale, \n",
      "too. She held herself with a grace and air of command that made him feel awkward and stumble-footed. \n",
      "She was barely tall enough to come up to his chest, but her presence was such that her height seemed the \n",
      "proper one, and he felt ungainly in his tallness. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Altogether she was like no one he had ever seen before. The wide hood of her cloak framed her face \n",
      "and dark hair, hanging in soft ringlets. He had never seen a grown woman with her hair unbraided every \n",
      "girl in the Two Rivers waited eagerly for the Women's Circle of her village to say she was old enough to \n",
      "wear a braid. Her clothes were just as strange. Her cloak was sky-blue velvet, with thick silver \n",
      "embroidery, leaves and vines and flowers, all along the edges. Her dress gleamed faintly as she moved, a \n",
      "darker blue than the cloak, and slashed with cream. A necklace of heavy gold links hung around her \n",
      "neck, while another gold chain, delicate and fastened in her hair, supported a small, sparkling blue stone \n",
      "in the middle of her forehead. A wide belt of woven gold encircled her waist, and on the second finger of \n",
      "her left hand was a gold ring in the shape of a serpent biting its own tail. He had certainly never seen a \n",
      "ring like that, though he recognized the Great Serpent, an even older symbol for eternity than the Wheel \n",
      "of Time. \n",

      "me?\" She laughed as their assents tumbled over one another. \"Here,\" she said, and Rand was surprised \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Moiraine focused on them again, and all three gave a little shake as if waking up. \"Later we will talk,\" she \n",

      "faded into leaf or shadow, and his cloak swirled through shades of gray and green and brown as it shifted \n",
      "in the wind. It almost seemed to disappear at times, that cloak, fading into whatever lay beyond it. His \n",
      "hair was long, and gray at the temples, held back from his face by a narrow leather headband. That face \n",
      "was made from stony planes and angles, weathered but unlined despite the gray in his hair. When he \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In passing the three youths his gaze ran over them, eyes as cold and blue as a midwinter dawn. It was as \n",
      "if he were weighing them in his mind, and there was no sign on his face of what the scales told him. He \n",
      "quickened his pace until he caught up to Moiraine, then slowed to walk by her shoulder, bending to \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be a fool.\" Mat laughed, but it was a shaky laugh. \"Warders are just in stories. Anyway, Warders \n",
      "have swords and armor covered in gold and jewels, and spend all their time up north, in the Great Blight, \n",
      "fighting evil and Trollocs and such.\" \n",

      "\"He could be a Warder,\" Ewin insisted \n",

      "\n",
      "\"Did you see any gold or jewels on him?\" Mat scoffed. \"Do we have Trollocs in the Two Rivers? We \n",
      "have sheep. I wonder what could ever have happened here to interest someone like her.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "upturned hand, but he had watched while Bran al'Vere weighed out the coins merchants brought from a \n",
      "dozen lands, and he had an idea of its value. That much silver would buy a good horse anywhere in the \n",
      "Two Rivers, with some left over. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked at Mat and saw the same stunned expression he knew must be On his own face. Tilting his \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nodding, Rand slowly did the same with his. He was not sure why, but somehow what Mat said \n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Ewin looked at his coin, then shook his head and stuffed the silver penny into his pocket. \"I'll keep it,\" he \n",

      "\"There's still the gleeman,\" Rand said, and the younger boy brightened. \n",
